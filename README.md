# Introduction

In the **keccak_integration** repository you can find an example of how a post-quantum crytpographic (PQC) hardware accelerator works. 



# Getting started
The repository is organized as followed.

There are two important branches:
* keccak_pulpissimo
* keccak_xheep

[PULPissimo](https://github.com/pulp-platform/pulpissimo.git) is a microcontroller from the open-source PULP platform project is used and configured to work with the 4-stage pipeline core RI5CY. Then, Keccak and [CRYSTALS-Kyber](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean/tree/master/crypto_kem) algorithms are compiled using [PULP toolchain](https://github.com/pulp-platform/pulp-riscv-gnu-toolchain), setting the optimization flag '-O3' and increasing the
stackâ€™s memory size.

[X-Heep](https://github.com/esl-epfl/x-heep.git) (eXtendable Heterogeneous Energy-Efficient Platform) is a RISC-V microcontroller described in SystemVerilog that can be configured to target small and tiny platforms as well as extended to support accelerators.
